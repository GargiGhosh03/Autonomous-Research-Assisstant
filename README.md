# 🧠 Autonomous Research Assistant (RA)

A fully local, AI-powered research assistant built using PDF parsing, chunking, semantic embedding with `sentence-transformers`, and vector search using `ChromaDB`. Designed to help researchers extract, search, and interact with large volumes of academic literature — with a **Streamlit interface** for natural question-answering.
